# Chess_1
This is a platform for two players to play a chess game and people to watch it,this still has many issues and I am working on them.

To start this project ,follow the following steps ->
1. Navigate to the directory you want to clone this project into in the command line.
2. paste the following command "git clone https://github.com/TLEonTestCase37/Chess_1.git"
3. After cloning the repo, paste this command to download all the neccessary node modules "npm i",make sure you already have npm installed or use any package manager of your own prefernce.
4. Finally run the project by typing "nodemon app.js",make sure you have nodemon installed (I already have noodemon installed globally).


This is a project I made to revise my concepts of JS and socket.io and I will be improving them in the near future.
